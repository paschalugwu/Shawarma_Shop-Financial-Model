**Total Sources of Funds:** **₦5,500,000.00**

### Revenue Projections

Based on market research and analysis of similar shops in the area, the following revenue assumptions have been made:

1. **Daily Sales Volume:** An average of 120 wraps of shawarma per day throughout the year.
2. **Product Mix:**
   - **Large Wraps:** 40% of total sales
   - **Small Wraps:** 60% of total sales
3. **Pricing:**
   - **Large Wrap:** ₦4,000.00 each
   - **Small Wrap:** ₦3,500.00 each

### Operating Expenses

Projected operating costs for running the shop include:

- **Rent Expense:** ₦1,200,000 per month
- **Consumables Cost:** ₦600.00 per wrap (average cost across all wrap sizes)
- **Staff Costs:**

### Seasonality Factors

Operational assumptions regarding business days and expected fluctuations:

- **Monthly Business Days:** Adjusted per month to reflect holidays and weekends.
- **Seasonal Adjustments:** Sales volume projections account for seasonal trends and peak periods to ensure realistic forecasting.

### Scenario Analysis

I believe that the main drivers of profitability for the shop will be the average number of wraps sold per day and the rent paid. To account for potential variations, I've implemented a scenario analysis:

- **Worst-Case Scenario:**
  - Reduce wraps sold per day by 20 wraps.
  - Increase rent by 10%.

- **Best-Case Scenario:**
  - Increase wraps sold per day by 20 wraps.
  - Reduce rent by 10%.

These scenarios help gauge the financial impact of changes in key business drivers, ensuring robust planning and risk management.

## Financial Statements

### Income Statement

The income statement projects the shop's profitability over the first year:

- **Revenue Calculation:**
  - Calculate the total number of wraps sold per day, adjusted for seasonality.
  - Split the total wraps into large and small based on the 40/60 ratio.
  - Multiply the number of wraps by their respective prices to compute monthly revenue.
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**
  - Multiply the total wraps sold by the consumables cost per wrap.
- **Operating Expenses:**
  - Include rent, staff salaries, utilities, and other overheads.
- **Depreciation:**
  - Apply straight-line depreciation for fixed assets.
- **Net Income Before Tax:**
  - Revenue minus COGS and operating expenses.
- **Net Income After Tax:**
  - Apply the 30% income tax rate.

### Balance Sheet

The balance sheet provides a snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity:

- **Assets:**
  - **Current Assets:** Cash and inventory.
  - **Fixed Assets:** Shawarma machine, furniture, and fixtures (less accumulated depreciation).
- **Liabilities:**
  - **Short-Term Liabilities:** Any payables or accrued expenses.
  - **Long-Term Liabilities:** Bank loan.
- **Equity:**
  - Owner's equity investment.
  - Retained earnings.

### Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement tracks the inflow and outflow of cash:

- **Cash Flows from Operating Activities:**
  - Cash receipts from sales.
  - Cash payments for COGS and operating expenses.
- **Cash Flows from Investing Activities:**
  - Initial purchase of fixed assets (reflected as cash outflows).
- **Cash Flows from Financing Activities:**
  - Proceeds from the bank loan.
  - Owner's equity contribution.

## Depreciation Schedule

A detailed depreciation schedule using the straight-line method:

- **Shawarma Machine:**
  - **Cost:** ₦1,000,000.00
